This is a simple program to find words in an N-by-N grid of letters. The particular puzzle this solves will provide a target length for words.

Provide a copy of the letter grid, a reference dictionary of words, and a target word length. The code will search the grid and provide a list of words that are present in the grid and the reference dictionary.

There are many reference dictionaries online. If case is important, you may want to make sure your dictionary matches the case of the letters in the grid you supply (e.g., all lowercase).

See the test file for examples of how to import and call the code.
